## To run the code: 

1. Clone [this github repository](https://github.com/spencerbertsch1/AI.git) locally and make sure you have python 3 installed. 
Alternatively, if you acquired this code from a zip file, simply unzip the file locally, `cd` into the `AI` directory, and continue to Step 2. 
   1. If you don't have python3 installed, you can install Anaconda and create a new Conda environment using the following command:
      1. `$ conda create -n CS-276 python=3.8`
   2. Then activate the new environment by running the following command:
       1. `$ conda activate CS-276`
   3. Then process to the following step. 
   

2. `cd` to the ChickensAndFoxes directory by running the following command:
   1. `$ cd ChickensAndFoxes`


3. Run the following command to run the foxes.py file. 
   1. `$ python foxes.py`


4. You will see the output of each search algorithm applied to each of the test cases provided in the assignment. If you want to see the output for
a single test case instead of all of them, just comment a few of the print statements in foxes.py, then run the above command again.
