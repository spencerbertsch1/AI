## To run the code:

1. Clone [this github repository](https://github.com/spencerbertsch1/AI.git) locally and `cd` into the `AI` directory.
   Alternatively, if you acquired this code from a zip file, simply unzip the file locally, `cd` into the `AI` directory, and continue to Step 2.
   In order to run any of the test scripts in this repository, you will need python 3.
    1. If you don't have python 3 installed, you can install Anaconda and create a new Conda environment using the following command:
        1. `$ conda create -n CS-276 python=3.8`
    2. Then activate the new environment by running the following command:
        1. `$ conda activate CS-276`
    3. cd into the AI directory and install the necessary requirements by running the following commands:
        1. `$ cd AI`
        2. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
    4. Then proceed to the following step.


2. `cd` to the HiddenMarkovModels directory by running the following command:
    1. `$ cd HiddenMarkovModels`
    

### To Run Filtering:
3. Run the following command to run the test_filtering.py file.
    1. `$ python3 test_filtering.py`
